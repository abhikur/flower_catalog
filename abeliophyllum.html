				Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf) is a monotypic genus 
				of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one 
				species, Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea,where it is endangered
				in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but
				differs in having white, not yellow, flowers. </p>
				<p>It is a deciduous shrub growing
				to 1–2 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,
				pubescent both above and below. The flowers are pro-duced in earlyspring
				before the new leaves appear;
				they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed corolla. 
				The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3 cm diameter. It is cultivated as
				an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.
